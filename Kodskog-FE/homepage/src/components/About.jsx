            I'm Hadi, a tech enthusiast. I've been on a relentless quest for endless learning.

            I'm working at Amazon Web Services as a software developer and graduated from Malm√∂ University with B.Sc. in Computer Science with specialization in Computer Systems Development

            My interests in software development are multifaceted, with my latest focus being on Chaos Engineering. This involves intentionally introducing disturbances into systems to test their resilience and ensure they can withstand real-world scenarios.

            Outside of work, I love engaging and bonding with my peers and friends over fika (Swedish for coffee break), football, volleyball, badminton, hiking, gaming, music, watching great movies or series, and many other activities.
